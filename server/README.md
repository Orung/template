# Recipe App

 An app that allows its users to design a recipe for foods with information such as the name of the food, the ingredients, cooking instructions, and supporting images. Reci-print, using this information, generates a customized and printable recipe card for them (in PDF format). Their recipe cards are made available on the app for other users to like and print.
